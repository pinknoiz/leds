Effects I want:

- rewrite all to the new model stuff
    - try the mercator stuff in here

- try out the faded_vert_line() on another sphere that has less / more pixels
- concurrently run shows? 
    - like having a small ring on the top and bottom blink while running sine waves or something
- do something with raindrops falling based on gravity - many starting at diff times
- build some helper functions
    - loop with 'over' - do the right thing with arange not including the end
    - loop with 'up'
    - over goes from 0 to row[abs(up)-1]    !! have a function
        (see horizontal_ring())
- fix all the animations again with arange, etc.
    - also update to use faded_pixel ?

- make a small 4 LED cube. Move the beam around inbetween the four LEDs. So that the neighbors (the 4 LEDs) light up based on how close the beam is. Maybe when the beam is right on the LED, make it white. 
    - throw a few of those ont he ball and have them all do the same animation
- implement mercator mapping for x-y stuff
- have like a laser pointer drawing stuff
    - i bright pixel moving around, leaving a trail of a sine curve
- intersect a plane with the sphere and roate it up and down
- text: need a 5x3 font

    - i have one in a ttf file 
- Check out this video for inspiration: https://www.facebook.com/EDMTunes/videos/1087499167960861/
- blink all same color at different speeds
- explode something outwards, like a heart beating
- have two filled circles (one blue, one red) move into opposit directions around the sphere
- fill sphere with rainbow patches (each vertical line has a slightly different rainbow color)
 	- rotate it
	- same for horizontal
- have a band going across the globe (4 pixels wide) in an angle, not horizontal, but like 15% - Then fade out the outside, and make it move up and down - it's almost like a hand moves over the pixels and the lights move with it. Sometimes go all the way down, sometimes just to the equator - fast and slow
- within two rows of equator pixels (or three), light up multiple LEDs next to each other and rotate it around. 
- when doing the horizontal rings up and down, light up multiple rows, not just one. Also: use like every other column, start at bottom, then move 5 pixels in slowly as lines coming up. Fade the ends. Move them all the way up, disappear, then back down.

- Do somethign with OSC

Could do better:
- have a blue dot start somewhere and circularlly fill up the entire sphere
    circle.exploding_dot()

Do something with the clock
Do something with LEAP
Do something with audio and ball flickering based on that
